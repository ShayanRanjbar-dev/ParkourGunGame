Hello

FOR FBX USERS : 
Metallic, Roughness, Alpha may NOT WORK properly, 
you may be need to re plug them or ADJUST the value.


FOR UNITY USERS : 
If material have alpha : you'll need to enable alpha cliping in the material inspector's tab if there's alpha texture 
or if old rendering pipeline : change opaque to something :)
and you guys are also FBX USERS so you'll need to replug the materials if needed

FOR GLTF GLB USERS: 
nothing to do, should work fine :) 


UNREAL ENGINE :
If you are using UNREAL ENGINE please USE GLB,GLTF so you don't have to setup all the materials, 
but if you persist to use fbx files, then when importing, CHECK FLIPPED -Y FOR NORMAL MAP option.


For this asset specifically I recommend to use Non PBR setup, just A diffuse or even an unlit shader would work best/ but you can do whatever you want 


If you think my work is usefull, you can donate me a little thing in itch,
that would help me to make more FREE assets
